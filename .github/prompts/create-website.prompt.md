Design a mobile-first, one-page RSVP website for a 1st birthday + christening celebration in the Philippines. Look & feel: soft, airy, modern, and warm—minimal but sweet.

Color palette (pink-led): blush/baby pink as the primary, warm white/cream as the base, light sage as secondary, and a tiny touch of champagne gold for dividers/icons (keep gold subtle). Avoid strong or saturated colors.

Typography: elegant serif for headings + clean sans-serif for body. Headings feel gentle and celebratory; body text highly readable on mobile.

Layout & style: lots of white space, rounded cards, soft shadows, thin dividers, delicate line icons. Hero section features a baby photo placeholder in a rounded frame (or full-width photo with soft gradient overlay). Add very light confetti/balloon accents in the background—barely there.

Images: Use placeholder images for now (e.g., via https://placehold.co or simple colored boxes with labels). Include placeholders for: hero baby photo, optional gallery/photo strip section, and any decorative image spots.

Christening elements: subtle and tasteful only—tiny dove/angel silhouette or a simple cross as a small divider motif. Keep it gentle, not heavy or formal.

Sections: Hero (name + "1st Birthday & Christening"), Event Details (date/time/venue), RSVP form (name, guests, attendance, notes), Location/map block, FAQ (dress code, parking, gifts optional), and a simple footer with contact info.

Overall vibe: sweet, minimal, premium, family-friendly, and clearly Filipino-celebration joyful without clutter.
